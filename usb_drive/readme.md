### üõ†Ô∏è Requirements

- A mounted flash drive (e.g., `/media/<user>/YourDriveName`)
- `rsync` must be installed (`sudo apt install rsync`)
- The script must be executable (`chmod +x usb_backup.sh`)

### üïê Example Cron Job

To run the backup every minute to keep the files up-to-date:

```cron
* * * * * /path/to/usb_backup.sh >> /path/to/usb_backup.log 2>&1
